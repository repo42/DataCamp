# Track proposal: Scala

## Course 1 - Introduction to Functional Programming with Scala

* Description: Scala is one of the main programming languages in Data Science, especially due to extensive use of Apache Spark in Big data industry. It combines best of the both worlds - object-oriented programming and functional programming. In this hands-on course we will get familiar with both programming paradigms, set up Scala with its supporting tools on computer and learn the basic Scala syntax.
* Learning objectives: Learner will be able to
  * distinguish between imperative and declarative programming paradigm;
  * set up the environment to start programming in Scala;
  * write programs in Scala, using basic constructors, such as variables, expressions, conditionals and functions.
* Prerequisites: /

## Course 2 - Object Oriented Programming in Scala

* Description: Object oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that reduces the complexity of systems. We will dig into the most important concepts of OOP, like classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritence and polymorphism, and implemented them in Scala.
* Learning objectives: Learner will be able to
  * explain OOP concepts in Scala;
  * differentiate among OOP concepts in Scala: classes, objects, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritence and polymorphism;
  * implement OOP concepts in Scala.
* Prerequisites: Previous course in this Track.

## Course 3 - Higher Order Functions in Scala

* Description: In this course we will cover an important concept in functional programming - higher order functions, which were introduced to provide a flexible way to compose programs. We will tackle currying as well and use it in Scala programs.
* Learning objectives: Learner will be able to
  * use higher order functions in Scala;
  * integrate currying into functions in Scala.
* Prerequisites: Previous courses in this Track.

## Course 4 - Scala Collections

* Description: Scala provides some nice collections, which enable the expression of algorithms in a very high level and concise way. We will take a closer look to immutable collections, like lists, vectors, maps, tuples and sets, which are used in purely functional programs.
* Learning objectives: Learner will be able to
  * analyze data structures and Scala collections;
  * design immutable collections in Scala, such as lists, vectors, maps, tuples and sets.
* Prerequisites: Previous courses in this Track.

## Course 5 - Pattern Matching in Scala

* Description: Pattern matching helps us decompose and navigate complex data structures in a very convenient and compact syntax and enables the compiler to check the logic of the code. It is an important and very useful tool in functional programming, as it process data based on its structure. In this course we will get familiar with pattern matching in Scala.
* Learning objectives: Learner will be able to
  * explain when to use pattern matching;
  * solve the problem of decomposition with pattern matching in Scala.
* Prerequisites: Previous courses in this Track.

## Course 6 - Scala Frameworks

* Description: Scala community is rapidly growing with its new frameworks and tools as well. In this course we will have a brief look at Scala's most popular frameworks, such as Apache Spark, Akka, Lift and Play.
* Learning objectives: Learner will be able to
  * examine different Scala frameworks and tools, such as Apache Spark, Akka, Lift and Play;
  * select appropriate Scala framework or tool to solve specific problem.
* Prerequisites: Previous courses in this Track.
